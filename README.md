# Animal Recognition Project
It is Artificial Intelligence Project using machine learning convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm model.

## Project Overview

This project aims to recognize various animals using machine learning models. The model has been trained on ten different categories of animals:

- Butterfly
- Cat
- Chicken
- Cow
- Dog
- Elephant
- Goat
- Horse
- Spider
- Squirrel

Users can input images of these animals into the model, and it will predict the category of the animal present in the image.

## Libraries to Installation
- All the dependencies or libraries needed to run the code are  in requirement.txt file

## Project Structure

The project structure includes:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `animal_recognition_model.py`: Holds the trained machine learning model.
- `ModelTrainer`: Includes the source code of model builder.
- `projectAI.py`: Includes the source code from animal recognition to predict.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.

## Usage

## Why use CNN Model?
  
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is specifically designed to work with image data. CNNs excel at tasks like image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. The key feature of CNNs is their ability to extract spatial features from images using convolutional filters. These filters are learned during the training process and allow the CNN to identify patterns and features in the image data.
